## Introduction
Streaming Service Modeling is a C++ program designed to simulate the management of a video catalog for a streaming platform. The aim is to provide users with an intuitive interface to rate and filter videos, enhancing their content discovery experience.

## Technologies
- **Language**: C++
- **File Handling**: Standard I/O for reading video catalog from external files.
- **Data Structures**: Utilizes classes and vectors for efficient data management.

## Launch
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
2. Run the executable and follow the on-screen instructions to manage the video catalog.

## Scope of Functionalities
- Load and display a catalog of movies and episodes from a file.
- Allow users to rate videos, calculating average ratings dynamically.
- Filter videos based on minimum ratings or genres.

## Examples of Use
- **View all videos**: List all movies and episodes with their average ratings.
- **Rate a video**: Provide a rating for a specific video and see the updated average.
- **Search by rating**: Find videos with a rating above a user-defined threshold.
- **Search by genre**: Filter videos based on selected genres.

## Project Status
Completed

## Sources
- Project inspiration and basic structure derived from a college project to simulate a streaming service's video catalog management.
